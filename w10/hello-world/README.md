# App: hello-world

# Installing a light-weight version of an app
A light-weight version excludes the `npm_modules` folder. This folder typically includes a large number of dependencies and is therefore quite large in size.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

# Customize configuration

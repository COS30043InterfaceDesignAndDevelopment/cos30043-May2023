# Bootstrap break points

## Responsive containers
Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply `max-width`s for each of the higher breakpoints. 

For example, `.container-sm` is 100% wide to start until the `sm` breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`
